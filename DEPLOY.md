# Deploying Zoe Life

The site is static: HTML, CSS, one small JS file, self-hosted fonts, local
images. No server, no database, no build step needed to *serve* it. Any static
host works. GitHub Pages is wired up already.

Nothing here has been pointed at a domain. DNS is yours to change. Keep
Squarespace live until the switchover checklist below is done.

---

## 1. Build

```bash
node tools/build.mjs              # production: indexable, canonical zoelifehub.com
node tools/build.mjs --staging    # staging: noindex + robots Disallow
```

The build writes the six public pages plus moved-url stubs
(`family-life.html`, `appointments.html`), `404.html`, `robots.txt`,
`sitemap.xml`, `favicon.svg` and `js/config.js`.

**Default the deploy to `--staging` until the domain actually switches.** A
production build published anywhere other than zoelifehub.com creates a second
indexable copy of the client's live site, which competes with it in search.

## 2. Configure the integrations

Every integration is **fail closed** by default. With nothing configured the
contact form validates, then tells the visitor plainly that it was not
delivered. It never fakes a success. Book checkout and Google Calendar booking
behave the same way.

Set these as environment variables at build time, or as GitHub repository
variables (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables):

| Variable | Effect when set | When unset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ZOE_SITE_URL` | Canonical URLs and sitemap | `https://www.zoelifehub.com` |
| `ZOE_FORM_ENDPOINT` | Contact form POSTs here; success requires an accepted provider response | Form refuses to send, says so |
| `ZOE_NEWSLETTER_ENDPOINT` | Signup POSTs here; success requires an accepted provider response | Signup refuses, says so |
| `ZOE_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_BOOKING_URL` | Consult page links to Google Calendar appointment scheduling | Shows a labeled `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_BOOKING_URL` placeholder |
| `ZOE_BOOKING_URL` | Fallback for the consult link if the Google Calendar variable is empty | Same placeholder |
| `ZOE_AMAZON_DEVOTIONAL_URL` | Amazon button for the 7-Day Devotional | Hidden until set |
| `ZOE_ETSY_DEVOTIONAL_URL` | Etsy button for the 7-Day Devotional | Hidden until set |
| `ZOE_GUMROAD_DEVOTIONAL_URL` | Gumroad button for the 7-Day Devotional | Hidden until set |
| `ZOE_STRIPE_DEVOTIONAL_URL` | Stripe button for the 7-Day Devotional | Hidden until set |
| `ZOE_PAYPAL_DEVOTIONAL_URL` | PayPal button for the 7-Day Devotional | Hidden until set |
| `ZOE_AMAZON_JOURNAL_URL` | Amazon button for the 100-Day Journal | Hidden until set |
| `ZOE_ETSY_JOURNAL_URL` | Etsy button for the 100-Day Journal | Hidden until set |
| `ZOE_GUMROAD_JOURNAL_URL` | Gumroad button for the 100-Day Journal | Hidden until set |
| `ZOE_STRIPE_JOURNAL_URL` | Stripe button for the 100-Day Journal | Hidden until set |
| `ZOE_PAYPAL_JOURNAL_URL` | PayPal button for the 100-Day Journal | Hidden until set |
| `ZOE_MODE` | `production` makes the workflow build indexable | staging |

The form posts `multipart/form-data` with `Accept: application/json`. The UI
expects a JSON payload with `success: true` or `success: "true"`; a bare 2xx is
not treated as delivery.
Field names are `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `phone`, `reason`,
`reasonOther`, `message`, plus `_replyto`, `_subject`, `form_type`, and a
provider-recognized `_honey` honeypot.

The configured provider is FormSubmit at
`https://formsubmit.co/ajax/contact@zoelifehub.com` for both contact messages and
mailing-list signup requests. FormSubmit requires a one-time activation click in
the `contact@zoelifehub.com` inbox before it will accept messages. Its published
documentation says it retains submissions for 30 days before deletion. A signup
request is emailed to Zoe Life for processing; this setup does not claim to add
the address to a separate email-marketing database.

Ordinary (non-staging) rebuilds without these variables keep any existing
non-null https values already in `js/config.js`, including the live FormSubmit
and Google Calendar URLs. Staging/`--staging` stays fail-closed when there is
nothing to preserve. Env vars still override when set.

Do not invent prices or storefront URLs. Amazon, Etsy, Gumroad, Stripe, and
PayPal buttons appear only when those environment URLs are real `https` links.
If none are set, Books keeps the purchase-coming copy. All buy-link env vars
are https-only; `http:` and `javascript:` values fail the build.

> After activation, send a synthetic end-to-end test through each form and
> confirm both messages arrived in `contact@zoelifehub.com` before launch. A form
> that silently drops enquiries is worse than one that admits it is not connected.

Consultation booking is **Google Calendar appointment scheduling** on the Zoe
Life Workspace calendar (20-minute consults, Monday and Wednesday 6:00 to 8:00
PM Central). It is not Acuity / Squarespace Scheduling.

## 3. Deploy

### GitHub Pages (already wired)

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds, runs the checks, and can publish from
**Run workflow**. It refuses to deploy if the static checks fail.

One-time setup: **Settings > Pages > Source: GitHub Actions**.

Run it manually from the Actions tab with **Run workflow**, choosing `staging`
or `production`.

### Any other static host

Upload the repository root, or run the same copy step the workflow uses. Netlify,
Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, S3 and plain nginx all work with zero configuration.

## 4. Switching the domain over from Squarespace

Order matters. Do not cut DNS first.

1. **Verify the replacement is complete.** Meeting 3 items: banner wordmark,
   two Saturday books, real photos, Connect + Contact + consult placeholder,
   no cart, no stock, no couple workbook.
2. **Wire the form and mailing list**, and test both end to end with a real
   submission that actually arrives at `contact@zoelifehub.com`.
3. **Publish Amazon, Etsy, Gumroad, Stripe, and PayPal links** into the
   environment variables above, or leave the honest “purchase options coming”
   copy in place. Printed copies go through a print-on-demand partner, not a
   from-home shipping flow. Do not invent storefront URLs.
4. **Publish the Google Calendar appointment scheduling URL** as
   `ZOE_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_BOOKING_URL`.
5. **Add `CNAME`** to the repository root containing exactly:
   ```
   www.zoelifehub.com
   ```
   There is a `CNAME.example` in the repo to copy.
6. **Build for production** (`ZOE_MODE=production`) so pages become indexable
   and `robots.txt` allows crawling.
7. **Point DNS** at GitHub Pages, per GitHub's current instructions for an
   apex plus `www` setup.
8. **After propagation**, confirm HTTPS is issued, then submit
   `https://www.zoelifehub.com/sitemap.xml` in Google Search Console.

### What is lost by leaving Squarespace

Be explicit with Zoe Life about this before switching:

- **Commerce**: product listings, checkout, orders, inventory (replaced by
  Stripe / PayPal links when those URLs exist)
- **Scheduling**: Squarespace / Acuity (replaced by Google Calendar)
- **Forms**: Squarespace Form Storage and any notification rules
- **Email Campaigns**: the subscriber list lives in Squarespace until a
  newsletter endpoint is connected
- **Editing**: content changes become code changes, not drag and drop

None of these are blockers, but each needs a replacement chosen deliberately
rather than discovered missing after the switch.

## 5. Verify a build before shipping

```bash
node tools/build.mjs --staging
node tests/check-site.mjs
node tests/check-build.mjs
node tools/serve.mjs 8765     # then, in another shell:
node tools/qa.mjs             # includes a 390px mobile pass
node tools/qa-forms.mjs
```

`qa.mjs` and `qa-forms.mjs` drive real Chrome over the DevTools Protocol and
need the server running. There are no npm dependencies at any point.
