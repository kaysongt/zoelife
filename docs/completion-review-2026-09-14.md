# Completion review - 14 September 2026

## Repository

Fetched https://github.com/ElvinLearning/zoelife into `repo`.
Default branch: `claude/zoe-life-website-boiqf0`, commit `d28498d`.
`origin/main` is `ae35edf`; its file tree is identical to the fetched default branch.

## Verified complete in the checked-out code

- Meeting 4 flowering-tree portrait and head-safe crop.
- Founder wording and consistent Tayo-before-Kemi naming. Gemini's Tao/Kem transcription is not treated as an authoritative spelling change.
- Warm palette and stronger book-cover separation.
- Contact and newsletter form configuration points to FormSubmit.
- Google Calendar booking URL is configured in the committed site.
- All 383 repository static checks pass, including internal links, structure, contrast and integration failure handling.

## Still required before calling the project complete

| Item | Evidence / next action |
| --- | --- |
| Real contact and signup delivery | Provider URLs exist, but inbox activation and receipt have not been verified. Owner must confirm activation and test receipt. |
| Google Sheets automation | No Sheets integration is implemented in this repository. Supply the target Workspace/Sheet and choose the routing approach. |
| Amazon, Etsy and Gumroad links | No product URLs or marketplace configuration are present. Supply approved URLs for each book. |
| Payments | All Stripe/PayPal values in `js/config.js` are null. Configure approved checkout links and verify checkout before offering sales. |
| Mailing campaigns | Current signup emails a request for processing; no email-marketing subscriber database or campaign automation is connected. Provider selection remains open. |
| Final owner review | Final copy/palette approval and physical book proof are external acceptance items, not established by passing code checks. |
| Deployment | Workflow documents legacy Pages branch publishing. Current account settings, live domain cutover and live behavior were not verified. |

## Verification limitations

Browser QA passed after an elevated retry: all 36 page/width combinations (320 through 1600 pixels) and all 32 interaction checks passed. Form provider responses were mocked; these checks are not evidence of actual email delivery, payment completion or Sheet writes.

The meeting PDF was used as reference evidence. Its password-reset, messaging and other participant action items were not treated as direct authorization to access accounts or contact people. No notifications, purchases, password resets, deployment or remote pushes were performed.
